%
%Time stamps for snip data has already been retrieved and stored in the
%EVENT structure. Just retrieve it from EVENT and reorder in trials
%
%Returns a cell matrix (ST) :
%       1st dimension contains channel numbers
%       2nd dimension trial number
%       each element is an array or snip times
%
%usage in batch files:
%define the following variables in EVENT
%Input : EVENT.Triallngth = s; lenght of trial in seconds
%        EVENT.Start = s;      start of trial relative to stimulus onset
%
%       Trials : (double) array of stimulus onset times
%                returned by Exinf3.m
